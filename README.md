# rrvpackage
RRV package to perform reliability, resilience and vulnerability computations on drought indices
Written for use in CE 5315 Probabilistic Methods for Civil Engineers Course at TTU but can be used for other purposes too.  

The calculations are largely based on approaches discussed in: 
Hashimoto, T., Stedinger, J.R. and Loucks, D.P., 1982. Reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability criteria for water resource system performance evaluation. Water resources research, 18(1), pp.14-20.

The large-sample approximation is used to compute probabilities directly from data.  The maginitude of drought SPI is used to estimate a dimensional vulnerability metric.
